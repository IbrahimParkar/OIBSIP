# Sales_Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for my final task during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The project focuses on sales prediction and optimization, aiming to develop a robust machine-learning model to forecast sales accurately based on various factors, including advertising investments, market trends, and customer behavior.

## Project Objective

This project aims to empower businesses with actionable insights for better decision-making, resource allocation, and revenue optimization. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the sales prediction and optimization model helps organizations forecast sales more accurately and optimize their advertising strategies effectively.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: The repository includes the dataset for training and testing the sales prediction model. It consists of comprehensive data on advertising channels and corresponding sales figures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The code provides detailed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Development**: The repository contains the code for building the machine learning model, utilizing algorithms such as Linear Regression and Extra Trees Regressor to predict sales accurately.
- **Model Evaluation**: The code includes evaluation metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the performance of the sales prediction model.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to Oasis Infobyte for providing me with the opportunity to work on this exciting sales prediction and optimization project.
