## 1. Iris_Flower_Classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers based on their measurements. The goal is to accurately differentiate between three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The project utilizes popular machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to automate the classification process.

### Introduction:
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on creating a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers. By analyzing the measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, we aim to classify the flowers into their respective species. The project is crucial in various fields, including botany, horticulture, and environmental studies, where accurate flower classification is essential.

### Dataset:
We utilize the Iris flower dataset from Kaggle, which provides measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each Iris flower species. This dataset serves as the training and testing data for our classification models, allowing us to evaluate their performance.

### Algorithms:
In this project, we explore two machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Logistic Regression models the relationship between independent variables and the probability of a specific outcome, making it suitable for classification tasks. KNN, on the other hand, predicts the class of an instance based on the similarity to its neighboring instances in the feature space. By comparing the performance and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, we aim to determine the most suitable approach for Iris flower classification.

### Results:
Both Logistic Regression and KNN models achieved 100% accuracy on the given Iris flower dataset. This indicates that the models were able to accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. However, it is important to note that further evaluation on unseen data is necessary to assess their generalization capabilities.

### Conclusion:
The Iris Flower Classification project provided valuable hands-on experience in developing machine learning models, understanding classification algorithms, and analyzing real-world datasets. By successfully classifying Iris flowers, the project contributes to the advancement of flower classification in various domains.

## 2. Unemployment_Analysis_with_python

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the job market in India. By utilizing data analysis techniques and Python programming, we delve into a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into the unemployment trends across different regions and states. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the socio-economic effects of the pandemic and aid in the formulation of targeted strategies to address unemployment challenges in specific regions.

### Dataset:
The analysis is based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes information on states, dates, unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation rates. The dataset enables us to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on employment and identify the states that have been most affected, taking into account their respective regions.

### Project Overview:
- Utilized a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, containing information such as states, dates, frequency of measurement, estimated unemployment rate, estimated employed individuals, estimated labor participation rate, and region classification.
- Conducted data preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into unemployment trends across different regions and states in India.
- Utilized various data visualization techniques, including bar plots, box plots, sunburst plots, and scatter plots, to visualize and communicate the findings effectively.
- Analyzed the impact of the lockdown on unemployment rates before and after the enforcement of restrictions.
- Calculated the percentage change in unemployment rates to understand the magnitude of the impact.

### Key Findings:
- April and May showed the highest unemployment rates across states such as Puducherry

, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana.
- Northern states, southern states, and eastern states experienced the highest unemployment rates during April and May.
- The analysis revealed that the lockdown had the most significant impact on Puducherry, while Meghalaya was relatively less affected.
- North India exhibited the highest overall unemployment rate, followed by South India, East India, Northwest India, and West India.
