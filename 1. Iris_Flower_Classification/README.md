# Iris_Flower_Classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers based on their measurements. The goal is to accurately differentiate between three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The project utilizes popular machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to automate the classification process.

## Introduction:
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on creating a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers. By analyzing the measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, we aim to classify the flowers into their respective species. The project is crucial in various fields, including botany, horticulture, and environmental studies, where accurate flower classification is essential.

## Dataset:
We utilize the Iris flower dataset from kaggle, which provides measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each Iris flower species. This dataset serves as the training and testing data for our classification models, allowing us to evaluate their performance.

## Algorithms:
In this project, we explore two machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Logistic Regression models the relationship between independent variables and the probability of a specific outcome, making it suitable for classification tasks. KNN, on the other hand, predicts the class of an instance based on the similarity to its neighboring instances in the feature space. By comparing the performance and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, we aim to determine the most suitable approach for Iris flower classification.

## Results:
Both Logistic Regression and KNN models achieved 100% accuracy on the given Iris flower dataset. This indicates that the models were able to accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. However, it is important to note that further evaluation on unseen data is necessary to assess their generalization capabilities.

## Conclusion:
The Iris Flower Classification project provided valuable hands-on experience in developing machine learning models, understanding classification algorithms, and analyzing real-world datasets. By successfully classifying Iris flowers, the project contributes to the advancement of flower classification in various domains.
